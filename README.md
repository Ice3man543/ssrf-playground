# SSRF Playground

SSRF Playground is a platform to practice exploitation and testing for Server Side Request Forgery issues in web applications.

### Setup

Because this program using some package, you need to get it first:
```bash
go get github.com/sirupsen/logrus
```

### How to play?

Run the server by typing `go run .`

There are different challenges with varying level of difficulty. The end goal is accessing a service running at localhost to get the flag.

```bash
http://localhost:8082/flag
```

The flag is randomly generated with a hash of timestamp at the end.

Have fun playing. The UI is accessible at http://localhost:8001/
